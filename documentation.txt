Hello there, if you want to give this source to different Developer, remember to tell them to read my documentation below:

https://github.com/Nemure231/My-Docs/blob/main/README.md

Remember, that documentation is only for static website.

If your Developer use website based on a framework like CodeignIter/Laravel/Vue/NuxtJs/NextJs or other modern framework,

They need to follow the guide based on that framework to integrate Tailwindcss,

Because different framework have different way to integrate Tailwindcss.


Kindly Regards,
